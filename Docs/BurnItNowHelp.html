<H1>Help for BurnItNow</H1>
<BR>
<H2>Requierment</H2><PRE> 
	* cdrecord 2.01.01+ and mkisofs 2.01.01+
	* A burner that works with cdrecord 2.01.01+

</PRE> 
<H2>Options</H2><PRE>
	<B>BurnTab:</B>
		DataCD - Burns a data session on a CD.
		AudioCD - Burns audio tracks on a CD.
		MixCD - Burns one data session and audio tracks on a CD.
		
		Multisession - Lets you burn multiple times on a cd (ONLY DATA)
		On The Fly - Burns a VRCD without creating a imagefile
		Dummy mode - Test burn a cd (doesnt write on the cd)
		Eject - Ejects the CD after finish burning.
		
		Burning Speed - Lets you choose what speed the burner should burn with.
		
		Make Image - Make and saves an ISO image.
		Burn - Burns the CD. 
		
	<B>DataTab:</B>
		ISO9660 - Burns a pure ISO9660 cd
		Joliet - Burns a ISO9660 with Joliet ext.
		Windows 9x/ME - Burns a ISO9660 with support long filenames
		BeOS - Not implented yet
		Mac - Burns a hfs cd.
		RockRidge - Burns a UNIX cd for singel users systems.
		Real RockRidge - Burns a UNIX cd for multi users systems.
		
		Change Volume Name - Change the Volume name on the active VRCD
		
		Bootable CD - Lets you make Bootable CD:s just drop the select the boot file
				BurnItNow will make an new file that exactly 2.88 Mb with your
				boot file first in the file and the rest zeros.
				DONT DROP FILE THAT OVER 2.88 Mb!
				
	<B>AudioTab:</B>
		If you dont understand dont change any options
		
		pad - 		If the track is a data track, 15 sectors of zeroed data 
              			will  be  added  to the end of this and each subsequent 
              			data track.  In this case, the pad  option  is  super- 
              			seded by the padsize= option. It will remain however as 
              			a shorthand for padsize=15s.  If the -pad option refers 
              			to  an audio track, cdrecord will pad the audio data to 
              			be a multiple of 2352 bytes. The audio data padding  is 
              			done  with  binary  zeroes  which  is equal to absolute 
              			silence.
              			
		no fixate - 	The disk will only be fixated (i.e. a  TOC  for  a  CD- 
          			Reader  will be written). This may be used, if for some 
          			reason the disk has been written but not fixated.  This 
          			option  currently  does  not  work with old TEAC drives 
          			(CD-R50S and CD-R55S).
		
		swab - 		If this flag is present, audio data is assumed to be in 
          	   		byte-swapped  (little-endian) order.  Some types of CD- 
	           	   	Writers e.g. Yamaha, Sony and the new SCSI-3/mmc drives 
	          	   	require  audio  data  to  be presented in little-endian 
          	   		order, while other writers require  audio  data  to  be 
          	   		presented  in  the big-endian (network) byte order nor- 
          	   		mally used by the SCSI protocol.  Cdrecord knows  if  a 
          	   		CD-Recorder  needs  audio data in big- or little-endian 
          	   		order, and corrects the byte order of the  data  stream 
          	   		to  match the needs of the recorder.  You only need the 
          	   		-swab flag if your data stream  is  in  Intel  (little- 
          	   		endian) byte order. 

          	   		Note that the verbose output of cdrecord will show  you 
          	   		if  swapping is necessary to make the byte order of the 
          	   		input data fit the required byte order of the recorder. 
          	   		Cdrecord  will not show you if the -swab flag was actu- 
          	   		ally present for a track.
		
		preemp - 	If this flag is present, all TOC entries for subsequent 
          		 	audio tracks will indicate that the audio data has been 
          		 	sampled with 50/15 µsec preemphasis.  The data, however 
          		 	is not modified during the process of transferring from 
          		 	file to disk. This option has no effect on data tracks.
          		 	
	
	<B>CDRWTab:</B>
		Blank(list) - Choose blanktype.
		
		Blank Speed - Choose the speed you want to blank with
		
		Blank(Button) - Blank the CDRW
		
		
	<B>PrefsTab:</B>
		Devices - Choose burner.
		
		DAO - Set Disk At Once mode. This currently only  works  with 
        	      MMC drives that support non raw Session At Once mode.

		BurnProof -  this option is implemented to support Buffer Underrun Proof writing with
			     drives that use the Sanyo BURN-Proof technology.
        	      
	
	<B>LogTab:</B>
		Shows some information and errormessages.
