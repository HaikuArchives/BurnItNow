* Add vector icons, main app has one now, perhaps add more icons for various
    functions at some point.

* Add proper Archiving/Unarchiving for the main window
    This will be used for saving the settings/state and in the future could be
    used for saving and loading projects

* Add threading functions/classes for running the various tools
    Probably best to "borrow" the BCommandRunner class from the Haiku repository.
    This will need to take various commands, execute them, and then update a
    status bar somewhere, possibly a modal pop up window.
    * Implement functions to create an ISO image via mkisofs
    * Implement functions to run cdrecord for various things such as burning,
        device scanning, blanking, media info

* Replace Tracker in role of file manager for Data compilation view.

* Add more functions to Audio view, like support for MP3/OGG files. This view cannot handle more than one dropped file at once.

* Give more options to customize compilation, like CD label. Handle speed slider and checkboxes.

* Correct items alignement - some of them is askew.

* Write ATA/ATAPI devices support (dev=ATAPI).

* Investigate UDF/DVD support

* Localize the application
